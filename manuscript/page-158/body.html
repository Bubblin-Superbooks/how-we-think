Suppose we symbolize the qualities that suggest <em>flagpole</em> by the letters <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>; those that oppose this suggestion by the letters <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>. There is, of course, nothing inconsistent in the qualities themselves; but in pulling the mind to different and incongruous conclusions they conflict—hence the problem. Here the object is the discovery of some object (<em>O</em>), of which <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>, may all be appropriate traits—just as, in our first case, it is to discover a course of action which will combine existing conditions and a remoter result in a single whole. The method of solution is also the same: discovery of intermediate qualities (the position of the pilot house, of the pole, the need of an</p></div> </div>
