He who offers "a penny for your thoughts" does not expect to drive any great bargain. In calling the objects of his demand <em>thoughts</em>, he does not intend to ascribe to them dignity, consecutiveness, or truth. Any idle fancy, trivial recollection, or flitting impression will satisfy his demand. Daydreaming, building of castles in the air, that loose flux of casual and disconnected material that floats through our minds in relaxed moments are, in this random sense, <em>thinking</em>. More of our waking life than we should care</p></div> </div>
