Sometimes direct observation furnishes corroboration, as in the case of the pole on the boat. In other cases, as in that of the bubbles, experiment is required; that is, <em>conditions are deliberately arranged in accord with the requirements of an idea or hypothesis to see if the results theoretically indicated by the idea actually occur</em>. If it is found that the experimental results agree with the theoretical, or rationally deduced, results, and if there is reason to believe that <em>only</em> the conditions in question would yield such results, the confirmation is so strong as to induce a conclusionâ€”at least until contrary facts shall indicate the advisability of its revision.</p><p>Thinking comes between observations at the beginning and at the end</p></div> </div>
