<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">contrast factors</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">We have already trenched upon this factor of inductive method, the one that is the most important of all wherever it is feasible. Theoretically, one sample case <em>of the right kind</em> will be as good a basis for an inference as a thousand cases; but cases of the "right kind" rarely turn up spontaneously. We have to search for them, and we may have to <em>make</em> them. If we take cases just as we find them—whether one case or many cases—they contain much that is irrelevant to the problem in hand, while much that is relevant is obscure, hidden. The object of experimentation is the <em>construction, by regular steps taken on the basis of a plan thought out in advance, of a typical, crucial case</em>, a case formed with express reference to throwing light on the difficulty in question. All inductive methods rest (as already stated, p. 85) upon regulation of the conditions of observation and memory; experiment is simply the most adequate</p></div> </div>
