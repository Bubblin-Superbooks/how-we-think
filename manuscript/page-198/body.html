If the physician does not know the general laws of the physiology of the human body, he has little way of telling what is either peculiarly significant or peculiarly  exceptional in any particular case that he is called upon to treat. If he knows the laws of circulation, digestion, and respiration, he can deduce the conditions that should normally be found in a given case. These considerations give a base line from which the deviations and abnormalities of a particular case may be measured. In this way, <em>the nature of the problem at hand is located and defined</em>. Attention is not wasted upon features which though conspicuous have nothing to do</p></div> </div>
