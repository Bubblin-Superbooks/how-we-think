<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">form, size, color, and arrangement of parts have much less to do, and the uses, purposes, and functions of things and of their parts much more to do, with distinctness of character and meaning than we should be likely to think. What misleads us is the fact that the qualities of form, size, color, and so on, are <em>now</em> so distinct that we fail to see that the problem is precisely to account for the way in which they originally obtained their definiteness and conspicuousness. So far as we sit passive before objects, they are not distinguished out of a vague blur which swallows them all. Differences in the pitch and intensity of sounds leave behind a different feeling, but until we assume different attitudes toward them, or <em>do</em> something special in reference to them, their vague difference cannot be <em>intellectually</em> gripped and retained.</p><p>Children's drawings illustrate domination by value</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Children's drawings afford a further exemplification</p></div> </div>
