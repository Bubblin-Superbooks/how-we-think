One of these facts, the weight of the atmosphere, is then selectively seized upon as the key to the entire phenomenon. This disentangling constitutes <em>analysis</em>. But atmosphere and its pressure or weight is a fact not confined to this single instance. It is a fact familiar or at least discoverable as operative in a great number of other events. In fixing upon this imperceptible and minute fact as the essence or key to the elevation of water by the pump, the pump-fact has thus been assimilated to a whole group of ordinary facts from which it was previously isolated. This assimilation constitutes <em>synthesis</em>. Moreover, the fact of atmospheric pressure is itself a case of one of the commonest of all factsâ€”weight or gravitational force. Conclusions that apply to the common fact of weight are thus transferable to the consideration and</p></div> </div>
