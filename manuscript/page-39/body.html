<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">some difficulty that troubles him and disturbs his equilibrium, are as futile as advice to lift himself by his boot-straps.</p><p>Suggestions and past experience</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Given a difficulty, the next step is suggestion of some way outâ€”the formation of some tentative plan or project, the entertaining of some theory which will account for the peculiarities in question, the consideration of some solution for the problem. The data at hand cannot supply the solution; they can only suggest it. What, then, are the sources of the suggestion? Clearly past experience and prior knowledge. If the person has had some acquaintance with similar situations, if he has dealt with material of the same sort before, suggestions more or less apt and helpful are likely to arise. But unless there has been experience in some degree analogous, which may now be represented in imagination, confusion remains mere confusion.</p></div> </div>
