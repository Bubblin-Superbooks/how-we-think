<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">presented.</p><p>Limitations of natural symbols</p><p>Natural objects are signs of other things and events. Clouds stand for rain; a footprint represents game or an enemy; a projecting rock serves to indicate minerals below the surface. The limitations of natural signs are, however, great. (<em>i</em>) The physical or direct sense excitation tends to distract attention from what is meant or indicated. Almost every one will recall pointing out to a kitten or puppy some object of food, only to have the animal devote himself to the hand pointing, not to the thing pointed at. (<em>ii</em>) Where natural signs alone exist, we are mainly at the mercy of external happenings; we  have to wait until the natural event presents itself in order to be warned or advised of the possibility of some other event. (<em>iii</em>) Natural signs, not being originally intended to be signs, are cumbrous, bulky, inconvenient, unmanageable.</p></div> </div>
