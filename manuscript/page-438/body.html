<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>All insight into meaning effects generalization</p><p>(<em>iv</em>) Hence generalization is not a separate and single act; it is rather a constant tendency and function of the entire discussion or recitation. Every step forward toward an idea that comprehends, that explains, that unites what was isolated and therefore puzzling, generalizes. The little child generalizes as truly as the adolescent or adult, even though he does not arrive at the same generalities. If he is studying a river basin, his knowledge is generalized in so far as the various details that he apprehends are found to be the effects of a single force, as that of water pushing downward from gravity, or are seen to be successive stages of a single history of formation. Even if there were acquaintance with only one river, knowledge of it under such conditions would be generalized knowledge.</p><p>Insight into meaning requires formulation</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The factor of formulation, of conscious stating,</p></div> </div>
