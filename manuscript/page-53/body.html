<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>These various values of the power of thought may be summed up in the following quotation from John Stuart Mill. "To draw inferences," he says, "has been said to be the great business of life. Every one has daily, hourly, and momentary need of ascertaining facts which he has not directly observed: not from any general purpose of adding to his stock of knowledge, but because the facts themselves are of importance to his interests or to his occupations. The business of the magistrate, of the military commander, of the navigator, of the physician, of the agriculturist, <em>is merely to judge of evidence and to act accordingly</em>.... As they do this well or ill, so they discharge well or ill the duties of their several callings. <em>It is the only occupation in which the mind never ceases to be engaged.</em>"</p><p>â–£  2. <em>Importance of Direction in order to Realize these Values</em></p><p>Thinking goes astray</p></div> </div>
